Prompt Engineering Final Project -- Calendar Planner Pro / Scheduling Assistant

This project aims to help user manage the time effectively. It integrates with the Google Calendar to understand the existing routines and uses ChatGPT's natural language processing capabilities to prioritize the new events and find avaiable time slots.

To run Planner Pro, user will need to set up authentication first. This involves creating a `credential.json` file and obtaining an OpenAI API key. 
After completing this setup, run the code:
```python
python main.py
```
